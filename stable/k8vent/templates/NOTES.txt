Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}.

Your release is named {{ .Release.Name }}.

{{- with .Values.teamIds }}

By default, your Pod events will be sent to Atomist team(s) {{ . }}.
{{- else }}

You did not specify any Atomist team IDs, so only Pods with a valid
"atomist.com/k8vent" annotation setting webhook URLs will have their
Pod events sent to Atomist.
{{- end }}
