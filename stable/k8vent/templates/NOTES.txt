Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}.

Your release is named {{ .Release.Name }}.

{{- with (include "k8vent.workspaces" .) }}

By default, your Pod events will be sent to Atomist workspace(s)
{{ . }}.
{{- else }}

You did not specify any Atomist workspace IDs, so only Pods with a
valid "atomist.com/k8vent" annotation setting webhook URLs will have
their Pod events sent to Atomist.
{{- end }}
